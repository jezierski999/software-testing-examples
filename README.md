# 🧪 Software Testing Examples

This repository contains practical examples of software testing using various tools, techniques, and programming languages.

The goal is to document and explore different approaches to software testing — from basic manual test scenarios to advanced automated test scripts.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here

The repository is organized by testing type or tool. Each directory will contain focused examples for a given method or technology.

Examples may include:

- ✅ Unit Testing (e.g., Python `unittest`, Java `JUnit`)
- ✅ Integration Testing
- ✅ End-to-End (E2E) Testing (e.g., Selenium, Playwright)
- ✅ Web UI Testing
- ✅ API Testing (e.g., FastAPI + `pytest`, Postman collections)
- ✅ Manual Test Case Templates
- ✅ Test Automation Framework Snippets
- ✅ Exploratory Testing Notes or Documentation

Each example will typically include:

- A short description
- The test script or code
- Technologies used
- Optional `README.md` per subfolder

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

This repo may include examples using:

- Python (Pytest, Selenium, unittest)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (Playwright, Cypress)
- Java (JUnit, Selenium)
- Bash or command-line automation
- API testing tools (Postman, curl, HTTPie)
- Markdown for test case documentation

## 🚧 Work in progress

New examples are added regularly as I continue learning and practicing software testing techniques.
